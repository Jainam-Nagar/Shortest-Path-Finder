# Shortest-Path-Finder
The application's primary function is to determine the shortest path between points, and it accomplishes this by employing Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm relies on fundamental data structures like graphs and queues, which significantly enhance the application's efficiency and adaptability. When users interact with the application, it systematically calculates the most efficient route between specified points, leveraging the advantages of graph-based data structures and queue operations. One notable application of this functionality is in the optimization of metro train routes, where the integration of Dijkstra's algorithm and associated data structures contributes to the seamless and timely management of transportation services.
